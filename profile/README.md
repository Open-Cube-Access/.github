# 👋 Hey there!

We’re **Open Cube Access** — an **open-source crew** on a mission to make **Identity & Access Management (IAM)** simpler, smarter, and more open for everyone.  

Our main project, **OCA (Open Cube Access)**, is a next-gen **IGA (Identity Governance & Administration)** platform built to make the **Joiner–Mover–Leaver (JML)** process smooth and transparent — no more identity chaos 🚀

## 🧩 What’s inside the cube?

- **🖥️ OCA UI** – Your one-stop portal for access requests and app configuration.  
- **⚙️ OCA Workflow Machine** – The brain that runs workflows, automates approvals, and handles access reviews like a champ.  
- **🔗 OCA Native Connectors** – Ready-to-use integrations with your org’s data sources and endpoints.

## 💡 Our vibe

We’re three cybersecurity nerds who got tired of overcomplicated IAM tools — so we decided to build something open, flexible, and made *for the people*.
